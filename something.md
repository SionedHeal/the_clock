So I start with a yip 
in my file that is on git
the yip becomes a yop
when yip to the yop 
makes me bop to the top. 

But where is the clock who aut to talk?
They spoke and the spalk but never did they talk
Unless you hop to the branch
Where the master took a chance
To listen to the clock 
When he spoke a talk. 

Atleast that 's something to talk about.
